    \begin{abstract}
        The iNZight data analytics tool has been a popular choice for teaching statistics in New Zealand schools and universities. This report summarises the discussions and outcomes of two workshops held to discuss the rebuild of iNZight with statistics lecturers at The University of Auckland and Victoria University of Wellington. The aim of these workshops was to engage with stakeholders over the future direction of iNZight, with a focus on functionality that makes iNZight work for teaching statistics. While the primary focus was on the long term future, discussion inevitably touched on short-term issues that could be addressed in the current versions of iNZight to ensure it continues to provide for our users until such time as the rebuild is complete.
